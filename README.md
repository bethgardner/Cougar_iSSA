This repository is currently set up for review of "Cougars avoid wolves and humans with season- and sex-specific changes to space use and movement" by 
Aaron J. Wirsing, Lauren C. Satterfield, Calum X. Cunningham, Brian N. Kertson, Thomas M. Newsome, Trent Roussin, Savanah L. Walker, and Beth Gardner

Data and script files to fit the integrated step selection analyses presented in the paper. The data are from GPS collared cougars in Washington State 
from 2017 - 2020 as part of the Washington Predator Prey Project and are located in the Data folder. There are two scripts in the Scripts folder to fit
the full models by sex and season and model on the subset of the data to include distance to wolf.
